# Insurance_Premium_Prediction
This was done to predict the insurance premium of a customer based on given data with R coding.

The choosen insuranceData file contains a sample of 1471 records of insurance contractors currently enrolled in an insurance plan 
in a famous insurance company in Sri Lanka. It includes some characteristics of the patient and the premium decided by the insurance company.

The features are:
